#  Sonic the Hedgehog Deep Reinforcement Learning
Personal project for pytorch implementations of various deep reinforcement learning agents and algos for Sonic the Hedgehog environments via retro-gym.

Note:
- Setup venv to run retro environments and load ROMs after buying from Steam
- Main file to run ai_test
- Altered retro gym env with wrapper classes in sonic_env.py [2]
